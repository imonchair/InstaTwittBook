I started writing the basic scripts, to run this correctly you need to cd, into the directroy and then type . venv/bin/activate if you are running windows try venv\scripts\activate

Flask is already installed so it should work, when you want to test go back to your terminal/command prompt and type python hello.py this will build the server, type localhost:5000/login into your browser and give it ago, if it doesn't work add an issue to the github page, make sure to commit any files you change! We use virtualvenv so your python path isn't modified.
